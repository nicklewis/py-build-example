## Flox Build example Poetry application

Run `flox build` to produce the package.

Create a _new_ Flox environment and `flox install <result>`. Also `flox install python3`.

Activate the new Flox environment and run `mycoolcli`.

Note that running `<result>/bin/mycoolcli` without installing to an environment will not work, nor will installing the package to an environment that doesn't have `python3` explicitly installed.
